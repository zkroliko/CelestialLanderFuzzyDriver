# CelestialLanderFuzzyDriver

A simple controller implemented using JFuzzyLogic with Java code serving as a environment simulator.

The problem is landing a probe (or manned spacecraft) on some celestial body. 
Model includes gravity (g = 3.32) and simple atmospheric model (differential equation).

The vehicle position and inertia as well as engine impulse has been taken into account.

Vehicles reactions and engine power are fully configurable using controller.fcl file.

The graphical interface enables control of the situation itself (position,speed).
